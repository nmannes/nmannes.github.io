<p>
  I'm a software engineer by training, but I'm so so so much more than the
  technologies that I've used at the companies that I've worked at.
</p>

<p>
  That being said, my professional tech experience consists of (starting from the most recent):
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://academia.edu">Academia.edu</a> (Ruby on Rails, React)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>

        <a href="https://sezzle.com"> Sezzle </a> (Go and React)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>

        <a href="https://www.factset.com"> Factset </a> (Python and Vue.js)
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul> 
</p>
