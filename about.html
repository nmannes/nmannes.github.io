      In the winter of 2006, I am cast for a minor role in my
      <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/schools/M199">elementary school</a>'s
      production of Pinnochio. I have no lines
    </p>

      Something that would foreshadow the rest of my life, I enroll at
      <a href="https://www.thecomputerschool.org/"> The Computer School </a>
      in 2009

      In 2013, I first take a coding class at my
      <a href="https://stuy.enschool.org">high school</a>. I make a bot that
      plays the game Othello pretty well, but the code is lost to history so
      you're going to have to take my word for it
    </p>

      In the academic year of 2017-2018 I take 3 geology classes. I end up
      forgetting a lot of it but I still know more about rocks than I ever
      thought I wanted to and am grateful for the experience

      It is February of 2018. I get a call from an HR person at
      <a href="http://factset.com">Factset</a>. I did not blow the onsite
      interview. I have gotten my first legit tech job.

      It is June 22nd, 2018. I am on a flight to Cleveland to visit my
      grandparents. I did not bring anything to do on the flight. I am sitting
      next to my brother. He is reading
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1111.The_Power_Broker"
        >this book</a
      >. He tells me to read the first chapter. I am happy. I have found
      something to do on the flight. I finish the book 6 months later
