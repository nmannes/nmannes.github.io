      In the winter of 2006, I was cast for a minor role in my
      <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/schools/M199">elementary school</a>'s
      production of Pinnochio. I had no lines :(
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      Something foreshadowing the rest of my life, I went to middle school at
      <a href="https://www.thecomputerschool.org/"> The Computer School </a>
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      In 2013, I first took a coding class at my
      <a href="https://stuy.enschool.org">high school</a>. I made a bot that
      played the game Othello pretty well, but the code is lost to history so
      you're going to have to take my word for it
    </p>

      In the academic year of 2017-2018 I took 3 geology classes. I ended up
      forgetting a lot of it but now I know more about rocks than I ever
      thought I wanted to and am grateful for the experience. A quote from my
      professor I sometimes think about is, "The best Geologist is the one who
      has seen the
      most rocks". I think that applies to lots of other things, too

      Reader, imagine that it is February of 2018 and that you are me. I get a
      call from an HR person at
      <a href="http://factset.com">Factset</a>. I did not blow the onsite
      interview. I have gotten my first legit tech job.

      In June 22nd, 2018, I was on a flight to Cleveland to visit my
      grandparents. I did not bring anything to do on the flight, but my brother
      was
      sitting next to me and reading
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1111.The_Power_Broker">
        an annoyingly long book</a>.
      He told me to read the first
      chapter. I hemmed and hawed, but eventually did. I was happy. I found
      something to do on the flight. I finished the book like 6 months later

    <p>I graduated from Carleton College with a degree in Computer Science June
      8th, 2019</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>September 1st, 2019 (approximately) I moved to Minneapolis</p>

      October 8th, 2019 I began a tradition of bowling every Tuesday night with
      a few of my friends at
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgS54fqKxf0">my local bowling
        alley</a>. We always tried to get lane one and most of the time it was
      empty. Also, the oil was always a little bit off and that definitely
      prevented me from bowling a perfect game.

      In February, to occupy time at home, I learned how to make pierogies using
      <a
        href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/homemade-pierogi-recipe">this
        recipe</a>. They tasted good but I didn't have a rolling pin so the wine
      bottle I used instead was hard on my wrists.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before the Covid-19 pandemic really got going in the US I was crowned
      champion of the <a href="https://minneapolisgoaltimate.org/">
        Minneapolis Goaltimate League
      </a>. I have no idea what the team name was but we wore red shirts
    </p>

    <p>Bowling night was on hiatus March 10th, 2020 :(</p>

      To practice his video editing skills, my dad made this

        pierogies</a>

      I took some improv classes at some in this period. Also, a stand up class,
      and I did various sports leagues (volleyball, bowling, ultimate frisbee,
      goaltimate). And two pottery classes!
