      In the winter of 2006, I was cast for a minor role in my
      <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/schools/M199">elementary school</a>'s
      production of Pinnochio. I had no lines :(
    </p>

      Something foreshadowing the rest of my life, I went to middle school at
      <a href="https://www.thecomputerschool.org/"> The Computer School </a>
    </p>

      In 2013, I first took a coding class at my
      <a href="https://stuy.enschool.org">high school</a>. I made a bot that
      played the game Othello pretty well. When I demo'd it in front of the class,
      I was somewhat embarrassed that I lost to it. But that was the point I guess, so good job me!

      In the academic year of 2017-2018 I took 3 geology classes. I ended up
      forgetting a lot of it but now I know more about rocks than I ever
      thought I wanted to and am grateful for the experience. A quote from my
      professor I sometimes think about is, "The best geologist is the one who
      has seen the most rocks". I think that applies to lots of other things, too.

      Reader, imagine that it is February of 2018 and that you are me. I get a
      call from an HR person at
      <a href="http://factset.com">Factset</a>. It turns out that I did not blow the onsite
      interview. I have gotten my first legit tech job.

      October 8th, 2019 I began a tradition of bowling every Tuesday night with
      a few of my friends at
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgS54fqKxf0">my local bowling
        alley</a>. We always tried to get lane one and most of the time it was
      empty. Also, the oil was always a little bit off and that definitely
      prevented me from bowling a perfect game.

      In February, to occupy time at home, I learned how to make pierogies using
      <a
        href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/homemade-pierogi-recipe">this
        recipe</a>. They tasted good but I didn't have a rolling pin so the wine
      bottle I used instead was way too hard on my wrists. If I could do it all 
      over again, I'd invest in a rolling pin <strong>before</strong> making them.

      Before the Covid-19 pandemic really got going in the US I was crowned
      champion of the <a href="https://minneapolisgoaltimate.org/">
        Minneapolis Goaltimate League
      </a>. I have no idea what the team name was but we had to wear red shirts every week.
