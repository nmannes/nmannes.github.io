<p>
  Are you having a hard time with computer science? Do you find coding overly
  difficult? I have approximately four years of experience working
  professionally as a software developer.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you are a high school student, someone who wants to change careers, or
  just a hobbyist, I am here for you. If you need help with homework, we can
  work through it. I can also help you devise and execute on a project that is
  meaningful to you, which would also help teach you the programming skills you
  want to have.
</p>
<p>
  I will meet you at your level of experience. During our sessions, I will help
  guide you to make the key insights on your own. Depending on how I percieve
  your understading, I will guide you more or less.
