  <p>
    Are you having a hard time with computer science? Do you find coding overly
    difficult? I have approximately four years of experience working as a
    professional software developer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you are a high school student, someone who wants to change careers,
    or just a hobbyist, I am here for you. If you need help with homework, we
    can work through it. I will help you devise and execute on a project
    that is meaningful to you, which would also have the lovely side-effect of helping to teach you the programming
    skills you want to have.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will meet you at your level of experience. During our sessions, I will
    help guide you to be able to make the key insights on your own.
