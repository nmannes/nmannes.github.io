    Are you having a hard time with computer science? Do you find coding overly difficult? I have approximately four
    years of experience working professionally as a software developer, and I want this to be less difficult for you.

    Every student starts from a different place. I will meet you where you are whether you are a high school student,
    someone who wants to change careers, or just a hobbyist. If you just need help with homework, we can work through

    help you a little more or less depending on how I perceive your understanding of the materials.
