<p>
  Are you having a hard time with computer science? Do you find coding overly
  difficult? I have approximately four years of experience working
  professionally as a software developer.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you are a high school student, someone who wants to change careers, or
  just a hobbyist, I am here for you. If you just need help with homework, we
  can work through it. I could also help you devise and execute on a project
  that is meaningful to you and would also teach you the programming skills you
  want to have.
</p>
<p>
  I will meet you at your level of experience. During our sessions, I want to
  help guide you to be able to make the key insights on your own. I will help
  you a little more or less depending on how I perceive your understanding.
